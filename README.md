# Resistor-Inductor-Capacitor Circuit Modeling
This project simulates the behavior of a classical resistor-inductor-capacitor circuit using MATLAB + Simulink.
The model is based on teh second-order differential equation that governs RC and LC oscillatory behavior.

V' = LI'' + RI' + I/C

## Objectives
- build a baseline simulation of the circuit using Simulink
- explore different circuit arrangements (series & parallel)
- observe circuit responses to various parameter changes

## Files
- 'resistor_inductor_capacitor.slx' - main Simulink model
- 'circuit_diagrams.slx' - circuit diagrams and related equations
- 'RLC_constants.m' - MATLAB script for given constants
